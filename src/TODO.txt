It would appear that the best way to handle matchers is to require they be used
  for all arguments. When the invocation is executed if the matchers don't equal
  the method arguments in size just throw an Error.


Add some sort of eq(T[]) and anyArray(Class) method to Matchers.


It would be nice if I validated the Answers returned the correct type when I
  create the ProxyRule.


Eliminate hamcrest dependency
- I don't need all the functionality necessary for unit test frameworks
  like the ability to describe the issue (SelfDescribing)
