When we stub a method call we need to look at the answers and determine if
  any of them return a type incompatible with the return type of the method.
  This should include possible null returns on primitive return types.


It would be nice if the Stubber returned from a doReturn was typed to force
  any subsequent doReturn calls in the chain to be the same type.


It would be nice if I validated the Answers returned the correct type when I
  create the ProxyRule.

Need a matcher that will verify if a given item is contained in a set of
  varargs as opposed to the current model in which it must be exactly the
  specified item(s) in the specified order.
