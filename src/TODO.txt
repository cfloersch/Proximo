Improve significantly the anyVararg implementation. It should at least verify
  that the argument supplied to it is an array (a must for a varArg). Now that
  I am asking for the type (to satisfy the return type) it would be nice to
  actually verify the Vararg array's component type as well.



It would be nice if the Stubber returned from a doReturn was typed to force
  any subsequent doReturn calls in the chain to be the same type.


It would be nice if I validated the Answers returned the correct type when I
  create the ProxyRule.

Need a matcher that will verify if a given item is contained in a set of
  varargs as opposed to the current model in which it must be exactly the
  specified item(s) in the specified order.
