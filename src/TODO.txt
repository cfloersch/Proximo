Improve VarargMatcher and corresponding matching in ProxyRule to actually
  expand and match the last method argument. At present it would not be
  possible to actually match a set of vararg arguments. It might be nice
  to give a means to match actual args or number of args.

  To do that the OngoingStubbing would need to evaluate the number of
  matchers vs the number of parameter types. If matchers greater than
  parameter types and method is vararg then condense final matchers
  into some sort of array matcher.




It would be nice if the Stubber returned from a doReturn was typed to force
  any subsequent doReturn calls in the chain to be the same type.


It would be nice if I validated the Answers returned the correct type when I
  create the ProxyRule.
