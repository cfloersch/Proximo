It would appear that the best way to handle matchers is to require they be used
  for all arguments. When the invocation is executed if the matchers don't equal
  the method arguments in size just throw an Error.


Probably ought to create a generic class the implementes the various default
  return types so that I can use it in the Matchers class as well as the
  ProximoHandler class to return the appropriate type.





Eliminate hamcrest dependency
- I don't need all the functionality necessary for unit test frameworks
  like the ability to describe the issue (SelfDescribing)
