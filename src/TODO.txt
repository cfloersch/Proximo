It would be nice if the Stubber returned from a doReturn was typed to force
  any subsequent doReturn calls in the chain to be the same type.



Need a matcher that will verify if a given item is contained in a set of
  varargs as opposed to the current model in which it must be exactly the
  specified item(s) in the specified order.



It would be nice via GenericTypes to validate if a custom Answer returns a
  valid type for the given method. I am not sure if this is even really
  feasible but its worth looking into.
