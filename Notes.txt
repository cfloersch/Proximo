The call to invoke inside InvocationHandler will always give us a null
  argument array if the method that was invoked has no arguments.

Vararg methods will always report the vararg as a single argument. It
  will always be the last argument. Its parameter type will always be
  an array who's getComponentType will report the actual type.
